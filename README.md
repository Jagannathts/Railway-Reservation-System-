Railway Reservation System
In the railway reservation system project, the users can get both train information and train reservation details. I have built this detailed database to add details, show details, perform user management functions, and view passenger information. This system is basically concerned with online reservation of railway tickets to the passengers. Here we will store and retrieve information about the various transactions regarding a rail journey. By keeping track of all passengers, we can schedule their journey accordingly. Maintain records of passengers travelling in different trains during different dates.

FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM
 	Surfing of data will become easy
 	The wait time of the passengers will be reduced
 	Accuracy of the information
 	The whole process of reservation will be faster
 	Data will be efficient
